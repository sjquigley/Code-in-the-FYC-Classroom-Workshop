# *Code in the FYC Classroom*
*Thank you for assisting in the study. This document should provide you with information and links to implement coding in the FYC classroom.*<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Assisting in the Study - timeline
1. At the beginning  of the semester, assign either *Electrate Fuego* or *I am...A project in becoming.* 
2. Towards the middle or end of the semester, assign a multimodal composition assignmnet requiring students use the Webtext Generator

## Assignment 1 - Getting Started working with Code

*Assign either of the following:*

[I am...a project in becoming ](https://github.com/Pitt-Fuego/I-am-a-project-in-becoming)

[Electrate Fuego ](https://github.com/Pitt-Fuego/Electrate-Fuego)

## Invite students to particpate in the study.

Once students have completed both assignments, invite them to participate in the study allowing 15 muntes at the end of class. (students should complete the survey in ~10 min).

**On the day you plan to distribute the survey, email students this [content](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kj18WOf7wNIzCplrQWEqKx0NyD0p9GQZ5FbaHEzN1Bc/edit?usp=sharing) (Alternatively, you could post it to  Canvas.**

**Then Read Script:**

Over the course of the semester, you have used Pitt Fuego in various multimodal coding assignments. Please consider participating in a research study that measures student attitudes about learning code in the writing classroom. If you agree to be in this study, you will complete a brief online survey. The survey should take you about 10 to 15 minutes to complete. In your email (or on Canvas), you will find an Internal Review Board disclosure and a link to the survey if you consent. If you have questions or concerns about this study or have experienced a research-related problem or injury, contact the primary researcher, Stephen Quigley. You will find his contact information in the email. You will have 15 minutes to complete this survey. Alternatively, you can choose not to participate. Either choice will not affect your grade or standing at the University of Pittsburgh. <p>&nbsp;</p>


## Additional Resources

- [W3](https://www.w3schools.com) provides a wide range of code reference, tutorials, and a sandbox allowing code play.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) Code questions and aggregated answers.<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Text Editors 

Setting up **Atom** for Mac/Windows and **CodePad** for Chromebooks 

### (Mac)


1. Download "**Atom**" from [Atom.io](http://Atom.io)
1. Add HTML Preview 
	- from the dropdown menu, select **Atom>Preferences>Install**
	- In the search bar type "**aton-html-preview**." 
	- Select the package built by "**HARMSK**." Click "**Install**."
1. Adjust text wrapping 
	 -	from the dropdown menu, select **View>Toggle Soft Wrap** (this will force lines of code to conform to your viewer tab.)

### (Windows)

1. Download "**Atom**" from [Atom.io](http://Atom.io)
1. Add HTML Preview - from the dropdown menu, select **File>Settings.** In the tab that loads select **+Install** 
1. In the search bar type "**aton-html-preview**." 
1. Select the package built by "**HARMSK**." Click "**Install**."
1. Adjust text wrapping - from the dropdown menu, select **View>Toggle Soft Wrap** (this will force lines of code to conform to your viewer tab.)

### (Chromebook)

1. Download "**Code Pad Text Editor**" from [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/code-pad-text-editor/adaepfiocmagdimjecpifghcgfjlfmkh?hl=en-GB). 
1. From the dropdown menu, select **Editor>IDE Preferences**
1. Toggle "**Word wrap limit**" to the middle value (this will force lines of code to conform to your viewer tab.)<p>&nbsp;</p>




## Best Practices for Working with Code in the Classroom


* *Work with Code* – most all of the code your students will need to write has already been written. Encourage students to work with code, not write it. (Disagree? See our final entry)

* Admit ignorance – your students will be much more responsive to learning about code and computer science when they realize that their teachers are also learners.

* Be flexible – there are many solutions to any given problem. Use difference as an opportunity to engage learning, asking questions, and assessing quality in different circumstances.

* Don’t fix things for your students – teach students to learn how to learn by directing them to the right resources.

* Promote online learning spaces – most of the questions and answers we seek have already been discussed somewhere on the internet. Encourage students to discover and contribute to these spaces on sites like GitHub and Stack Overflow, and to use other learning spaces like W3.

* Leverage classroom knowledge – acknowledging your own limitations will encourage students who may possess more knowledge than you to speak up and take leadership roles.

* Set Deadlines, but be flexible – give your students all the time they need to figure out how to work with code. Demand excellence, but ensure learning.

* Think Small Groups – small groups provide a great way to help students learn to connect with the other through code.

* Offer Debugging Sessions – students will often arrive to class with big problems that require simple solutions. Allow students time to meet in small groups to solve their coding problems.

* Utilize Small Group Presentations - presenting work in small groups takes the pressure off of presenting in larger ones. They also allow students to ask more questions and learn more about their own learning.

* Group Share - After small group presentations, require each group to share-out the highlights of their experience, not only sharing what they made, but what they learned.

* Build Confidence – Be proud of your students! Encourage them to continue working with code and learning new technologies.

* Teach to Transfer - Offer plenty of time for students to assess what they learned and to process how they learned it. Focus on aspects of rhetoric, writing, and computational thinking that will transfer into other applications.

* Promote Other Kinds of Coding Experience – It may be unrealistic to learn more than Pitt Fuego in your classroom, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t encourage students to transfer their new knowledge and skills to learn more about code, even learning how to write their own.



SAMPLE TEACHING CYCLE (2-3 projects)

* Classroom/Code Icebreaker Start your class with code. Combine the standard introduction with code, presenting who they are, where they came from, and where they want to go. (see: Electrate Fuego or I AM; A Project in Becoming.)

* Stasis Theory Project Students will work with code to figure out what they want to write or what they want to make by constructing a question, conjecture, definition, quality, and policy. (see: Stasis Theory Machine, Elevator Pitch Generator)

* Multimodal Communication Document - Students will use the tools in Pitt Fuego to make a mobile-ready multimodal communication document. (See Pitt Fuego or any of our other Presentation Methods.<p>&nbsp;</p>
